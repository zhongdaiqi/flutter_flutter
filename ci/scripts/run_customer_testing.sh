# Run upstream customer_testing suite with OHOS-specific patches applied.
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Clone flutter/tests @ tests.version (from github.com, upstream canonical)
#   2. Apply OHOS patches via patch_tests_for_ohos.sh
#   3. Sync missing commits into mirror repos (e.g. packages/)
#   4. Resolve customer_testing tool deps
#   5. Run upstream run_tests.dart directly with registry/*.test glob
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - all (non-disabled) tests passed
#   1 - one or more tests failed
#   2 - environment/setup error (e.g., git clone failed)
