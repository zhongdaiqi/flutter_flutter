Flutter Engine
==============

Source of the original repository: https://github.com/flutter/engine

## Repository Description
This repository is an extension of the Flutter engine repository. It enables Flutter engine to run on OpenHarmony devices.

## How to Build

* Build environment:
1. Linux or macOS that support Flutter engine; Windows that supports **gen_snapshot**.
2. Access to the **allowed_hosts** field in the DEPS_ohos file.

* Build steps:
1. Set up a basic environment. For details, see the [official document](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Setting-up-the-Engine-development-environment).

   The following libraries need to be installed:

   ```
   sudo apt install python3
   sudo apt install pkg-config
   sudo apt install ninja-build
   ```

   For Windows:
   Refer to the section "Compiling for Windows"
   in the [official document](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Compiling-the-engine#compiling-for-windows).


2. Configure the file. Specifically, create an empty folder **engine**, create the **.gclient** file in this folder, and edit the file.

   ```
   solutions = [
   {
      "managed": False,
      "name": "src/flutter",
      "url": "git@gitcode.com:openharmony-tpc/flutter_engine.git@oh-3.22.0",
      "custom_deps": {},
      "deps_file": "DEPS_ohos",
      "safesync_url": "",
      "custom_vars": {"download_emsdk": True},
   },
   ]
   ```

3. Synchronize the code. In the **engine** directory, execute `gclient sync`. The engine source code and packages repository will be synchronized, and the **ohos_setup** task will be executed.

4. Download the SDK. Download the supporting development kits from [HarmonyOS SDK](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/develop). Suites downloaded from other platforms are not supported.

   ```sh
   # Environment variables to set: HarmonyOS SDK, ohpm, hvigor, and node.
   export TOOL_HOME=/Applications/DevEco-Studio.app/Contents # macOS environment
   export DEVECO_SDK_HOME=$TOOL_HOME/sdk # command-line-tools/sdk
   export PATH=$TOOL_HOME/tools/ohpm/bin:$PATH # command-line-tools/ohpm/bin
   export PATH=$TOOL_HOME/tools/hvigor/bin:$PATH # command-line-tools/ hvigor/bin
   export PATH=$TOOL_HOME/tools/node/bin:$PATH # command-line-tools/tool/node/bin
   ```

5. Start building. In the **engine** directory, execute `./ohos` to start building the Flutter engine that supports ohos devices.
Starting from version 3.22.0, the engine compilation will by default compile both the `local-engine` and `local-host-engine`. When the SDK specifies local compiled artifacts, it must specify both of these compiled artifacts. For example:

   ```shell
   flutter build hap --target-platform ohos-arm64 --release --local-engine=<DIR>/engine/src/out/ohos_release_arm64/ --local-engine-host=<DIR>/engine/src/out/host_release
   ```

6. Update code: In the engine directory, run `./ohos -b target-branch-name`.
For example, to build the engine code from the oh-3.22.0 branch, execute `./ohos -b oh-3.22.0.`

## FAQs
1. The message `Permission denied` is reported.<br>Execute `chmod +x < script file >` to add the execution permission.

2. To compile the engine in debug, release, or profile mode, execute `./ohos -t debug`, `./ohos -t release`, or `./ohos -t profile`, respectively.

3. To find the help, execute `./ohos -h`.

4. Different ways for handling newline characters by Windows, macOS, and Linux will cause different results of **dart vm snapshot hash** when installing the dart patches. You can obtain the value of **snapshot hash** through the following method:

   ```shell
   python xxx/src/third_party/dart/tools/make_version.py --format='{{SNAPSHOT_HASH}}'
   ```

   Here, **xxx** is the engine path you created.

   If the obtained value is not **8af474944053df1f0a3be6e6165fa7cf**, check whether all lines of the **xxx/src/third_party/dart/runtime/vm/dart.cc** file and the **xxx/src/third_party/dart/runtime/vm/image_snapshot.cc** file end with **LF**. For Windows, you can use **Notepad++** to check; for other systems, consult specific methods on your own.

5. After modifying the embedding layer code, running `./ohos` does not take effect. You need to modify the timestamp of any file in the C++ layer for the build system to recognize it (e.g., add a space in any C++ file, save it, then remove the space and save again). Re-run the build to trigger the embedding layer to be repackaged.

6. Configure automatic code navigation

   It is recommended to use the `vscode+clangd` plugin (note: it conflicts with C/C++ IntelliSense).
   Example configuration:
   ```json
    "clangd.path": "./src/flutter/buildtools/linux-x64/clang/bin/clangd",
    "clangd.arguments": [
      "--compile-commands-dir=./src/out/ohos_release_arm64/",
      "--query-driver=./src/flutter/buildtools/linux-x64/clang/bin/clang++"
    ],
    "C_Cpp.intelliSenseEngine": "disabled",
   ```

7. `gclient sync` error on Windows

   Key error message: `'A required privilege is not held by the client'`

   Solution: Go to Settings -> Developer Options -> Enable "Developer Mode"


## Code Building at the Embedding Layer

1. Edit **shell/platform/ohos/flutter_embedding/local.properties** as follows:

   ```
   sdk.dir=<OpenHarmony SDK directory>
   nodejs.dir=<nodejs SDK directory>
   ```

2. Copy the file to `shell/platform/ohos/flutter_embedding/flutter/libs/arm64-v8a/` from the built `engine` directory.
    1. For the debug or release version, copy `libflutter.so`.
    2. For the profile version, copy `libflutter.so` and `libvmservice_snapshot.so`.

3. In the **shell/platform/ohos/flutter_embedding** directory, execute the following instruction:

    ```
   # buildMode can be set to debug, release, or profile.
   hvigorw --mode module -p module=flutter@default -p product=default -p buildMode=debug assembleHar --no-daemon
    ```

4. Find the HAR file from the path `shell/platform/ohos/flutter_embedding/flutter/build/default/outputs/default/flutter.har`.

If you are using DevEco Studio of a Beta version and encounter the error message `must have required property 'compatibleSdkVersion', location: build-profile.json5:17:11` when building the project, refer to the section "Configuring Plugins" in chapter 6 "Creating a Project and Runing Hello World" of *DevEco Studio Environment Setup.docx* to modify the **shell/platform/ohos/flutter_embedding/hvigor/hvigor-config.json5** file.
